# Phase 2 Project
This is the repository that contains all files associated with the DS Flex Phase 2 Project.

## Project Overview

In this project, we used exploratory data analysis to investigate trends in film box office sales to genrate market entry insights for a company looking to enter the film industry.

### Business Problem

This company has decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. Before investing in a large movie project, they need to know which types of movies are doing well, which directors perform well within a reasonable budget, and whihc time of year is best to release. The results of this project are summarized in a preentation suitable to be presented to a non-techinical audience and translated to make clear business recommendations.

### The Data

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)

Data from IMDB is located in a SQLite database.

The data sets used in the investigation were the IMDB SQL database, as well as the The Numbers data set. These data sets were combined to get box office and budget information for specific movies and genres, as well as box office and budget information for specific directors, as well as their ratings. 

Once combined, there were 2,253 entries in the combined movie information and budget data set, and 3,012 entires in the combined director information and budget data set.
